TikTok,2,Talent acquisition team that is supporting Global Product.,"Nice pantry with variety of snacks and drinks. 
Office with great views and good location. 
Decent bento set for lunch. 
1 or 2 of the TAs are actually decent. 
This review only applies mostly to our lead, and some TAs","Context: Sourcers are under 1Y contract, we report directly to the Talent Acquisition (TA) Lead. And we support the full-time TAs in helping them to fill their openings. 

High Turnover: 
- 5 sourcers resigned in 2 months, it shows something. 
- 1 employee was abruptly fired without an official reason, receiving notice from the agency instead of from our own lead. 
- Various reasons circulated among full-time TAs, including ethnicity and performance issue, which does not make sense. Any logical and fair leader would give their employee a feedback first or at least have a review/warning period, right? Nope. Just straight up terminated. 

Poor Leadership: 
- Our lead demonstrates a lack of understanding of talent sourcing work and leadership. She is a manager. Not a leader people would want to follow. 
- During a recent 1-to-1 meeting, our lead expressed worrying remarks on the sudden departures of employees. Quote 'I‚Äôm very happy about those people who left. I don‚Äôt need them anyway. They are not performing. They lack resilience and they‚Äôre unable to take stress.' 
- If this sort of remark can come out from your leader, you know what type of environment you‚Äôll be working in. 
- Despite being on medical leave, you might still be expected to attend meetings and meet targets. And your targets remain the same. 

Out of Touch Leader and Unrealistic Goals: 
- cut-throat, competitive agency-style team environment. 
- our lead is disconnected from the complexities of talent sourcing, prioritizing numbers without considering role nuances, changing EP requirements, drying of candidate pool, or increasingly demanding hiring manager expectations due to reduced headcounts. 
- The work environment lacks collaboration and support, promoting an individualistic culture. 
- KPIs are set based on past top performer during a time when headcounts were plenty, and hiring managers were lax on the expectation, leading to unrealistic goals for sourcers. 
- Some of the set goals lack coherence, favoring quantity over quality just so she could show-off the raw numbers to her higher-ups and compete with other TA teams. 

Sourcer Responsibilities and Lack of Recognition: - As sourcers, our job scope extends far beyond the traditional definition of SOURCE-er. On top of just reaching out to candidates to receive and shortlisting CVs (like what a sourcer should do), we also need to conduct exploratory & interest call, candidate interview prep, follow up with hiring managers for feedback, follow up after each interviews, requesting referrals, providing regular pipeline updates to hiring manager, do talents mapping, and even assisting TAs in explaining unattainable targets set by themselves. Basically full process except making offer to candidates. 
- We have a new KPI to invite 6-8 engineers from top companies for 'lunch networking' each month. Isn't that a TA job? 
- Despite being titled sourcers, we are performing the 'Talent Acquisition' scope of work with much lesser remuneration and job stability. Meanwhile, the full-time TAs often complain about their workload without producing tangible outcomes or initiatives from their endless 'meetings'. 

Contract Renewal Challenges: 
- There is no opportunity for contract sourcers to transition into permanent positions. Contract renewals require constant chasing and begging, accompanied by lengthy report justifying why we should be renewed and highlighting our achievements. One of us only get our renewal contract signed 1 day before it lapse. 
- Progressing to become full-fledged TAs within this team is impossible, as the current full-time TAs will not leave (who would leave a good paying job that allows you to dump all your work on sourcers and only do salary offer?). 
- For context, 0 full-time TAs left since 2021, and 9 Sourcers (within 10 months) resigned. I wonder why. 

Bi-annual Performance Reviews: 
- The company-wide bi-annual performance review process last 2-3 weeks. 
- During this period, full-time TAs become exceptionally nice because they need reviews from ten individuals they closely collaborate with.
- Unfortunately, this review period disrupts operations significantly. Hiring managers neglect their piled up resume evaluations, and scheduling interviews becomes challenging as interviewers prioritize their performance reviews. Each review is an extensive two-page essay, requiring ten reviews from one another, adding to the workload. 
- Meanwhile, our targets for resume evaluations, introductory calls, and offers remain unchanged, further straining our workload during this time.", Recruitment Sourcer, Singapore,15-May-23,TRUE

TikTok,1,TA at Global Product,Good office and good company brand i guess.,"You know the saying - ""Never meet your heroes""? Yeah, after joining Tiktok, even using the app itself left me a bad taste in my mouth. 

Culture 
The culture at the GPRD TA team is super bad. You would think that a giant organization like TikTok is globalised but no. Meetings, documents and conversations are conducted in Mandarin Chinese even if there are people/minorities who do not understand the language. A

s someone who first joined the team, I could feel the segregation between the permanent employees and the contract staff. As a contract staff, you are treated like a peasant. On my first day, they gave me a nasty look when I was introduced to them, as if I was an annoyance. Very good first day experience! 

Diversity & Inclusion This is a joke.
As someone who did recruitment in this team, I can tell you that fluency in Chinese is an implicit requirement. Good luck to people with resumes that do not state that outright, because there's a lot of recruitment biases going around. 

Recruitment Strategy 
The recruitment strategy for this team is very straightforward. Spam everyone! You know those WhatsApp/Phone scammers? Guess what, this TA team is more persistent than them. Not replying to them out of lack of interest? Expect another message in 1/2 days. 

Without a doubt, this is a full-on agency environment. Brought in by the lead and maintained by the TA Partners, it's all about the numbers. People are sending random resumes to irrelevant roles just to boost their numbers. Oh and please if you join this team, please please keep track of your candidates that you entered into the system. People are always watching and will snatch from you once the locking period is up. 

All of this is because of the team culture and focus on numbers. Do well and they will clap for you, ""Top Performer of the Month"" and then it's back to spamming candidates. 

Everyone is burnt out and tired, there are a finite number of candidates that fit the criteria. I really doubt software engineers are born into this world every minute with full grasp of their tech stack that can sustain this insane recruitment strategy of spamming people and passing them around positions like their tissue paper.", Sourcer, Singapore,18-May-23,FALSE

TikTok,1,"Toxic culture, incompetent team leaders, Top-down management, avoid Chinese Company!",1. You get to work with young and talented local professionals; 2. Chances to take more responsibilities and learn from the job itself if you do not mind no work-life balance.,"Where do i begin? My list goes on... 1. Horrible talent management, they copy western companies' OKR and 360 degree performance review system, but TikTok leaders manipulated it in a way that you have to please your leader huge in order to get a good bonus as your 360 rating determines how much your bonus will be. That of course leads to a very top-down Chinese imperial management style. 2. Salary. HRBP and the team leads will try to negotiate so hard with you on your salary by leveraging the name TikTok which many believes it's the next Meta, but let's be honest, how far can TikTok go if they have a top-down management culture and bring in talents who later realise they're all underpaid? 3. Team leaders. Many of them are young and incompetent, they're in the lead position either because they know how to please the management or they are the loyalist, therefore, the more experienced talents will suffer big from inexperienced leads and unprofessionalism, they will feel very little chance to exceed unless they become a loyalist too. The team leaders' goals are very much for 360 performance review NOT because they want to bring impact, build a strong team nor nice culture. 4. Benefit. Many thinks employee benefit is good here, well, it maybe the case when the company was small and new here, it has been reducing employee benefits since ever, starts from hard salary negotiation by count in every cent of your flexible benefit and 3 months bonus you may or may not get (depends on how much your leader wants to give you), cheap lunch and snacks that are in trend to become worse due to cut in operation expenditure. 5. Corrupted leaders. Sexual harassment and hostile working environment are quite common, as mentioned, the result of a leader-pleased culture. 6. Resignation. This is a funny one. Let's say if your notice period is one month from 1 Nov to 30 Nov, then you agreed with HRBP to have your last day on 15 Nov, but you do not get paid for 1 Nov to 15 Nov in the end, because you need to pay back to TikTok for the shortened notice period from 16 Nov to 30 Nov! This is the most ridiculous policy i have ever experienced in my life... 7. Future outlook of social media platforms. In overall, weak moat for social media platforms like TikTok, look what happened at Meta and Twitter... TikTok has been expanding in oversea without a concrete plan since 2019, they do not even have headcount projection for each year, which means they could over hire without control. TikTok as the very few APPs that generates revenue, in current economic downturn, ad revenue will shrink, and when a Chinese company cuts its headcount, it can be brutal without anything like Meta gives employees 16 weeks salary, refer to what happened in tech sector in China. 8. My final advise, choose western companies over Chinese companies, for your own value system and mental health. TikTok may try to build its branding, but not if they understand the value of human dignity and respect.", Project Manager, Singapore,14-Nov-22,FALSE

TikTok,3,"Good Career Opportunity and Brand, but Low Compensation and Poor Leadership","1. Strong Brand Name - very attractive to future employers. 

2. People - some great people! Everyone is very helpful and collaborative from day 1. 

3. Impact and Scope - The roles are brought and wide allowing for a lot of great projects to work on and stretch yourself. You can build amazing profile and achievements. 

4. Daily food allowance and a lot of SWAG

5. Projects - a lot of problems to solve which will build your skills and experience.

6. Super fun and awesome user product.

7. 100% WFH and flexibility, until recently.

8. Speed - great start up speed that is maintained. You will learn to get things done and work fast. 

9. High performance environment.

10. Incredible collaborative tools and cloud solutions making collaboration amazing and easy. You can work from any device with easy.","1. Low Compensation: 
- TikTok pays WAY less than FAANG closer to Tier 3 companies. 
- No COL adjustment and only top performing staff get annual increments, based on ‚Äúperceived performance‚Äù. 
- Only ex-FAANG employees are paid well and have RSUs. The rest are underpaid. 

2. Poor Benefits and Insurance - the benefits are below standard and the insurance is bad for a supposedly leading tech company. 

3. Poor Management and Leadership: 
- Many of the senior management are ex-FAANG ICs who are given huge portfolio in TikTok. 
- In APAC, senior leaders can be incredibly rude. 

4. Heavy Perf Review Cycles: 
- Heavy perf cycles every 6 months with low pay adjustments, if any.
- There is no clear guidance on what is high performance. 

5. Secretive and Non Transparent: 
- Nothing is shared with employees and most FTEs are treated like contractors with even basic business data kept private or not allowed to be seen. 
- No pay bands are shared or explained. 
- Leaders do not answer questions in town-halls. 
- The employee survey results are kept secret and not shared even with mid-management.

6. Lack of Investment in the Employees: 
- The company has no Talent and Development team 
- Poor training team 
- No education reimbursements. 
- No rotation programs are available, either. 
- No mentorship programs. 
- No communities 

7. WLB 
- It varies between teams, however overall it is intense. 
- Often you have to do 2 jobs at the same time with the low pay (see #1).
- Your calendar blocks and time is often not respected. 

8. Disorganised: 
- Very disorganised with re-orgs creating teams with no clear roles. 
- Frequent changes of direction, leaders and strategy. 
- Many overlapping teams and roles. 
- Mostly 2 months planning and very frequent changes. 

9. No Care for Mental Health - no insurance coverage or care of your mental health and how you feel. Management only cares about revenue. 

10. High Attrition and Decline in Talent 
- Attrition is high with average tenure around 1.5 yrs with some leaving in 2-4 months time. 
- The company has started to hire mediocre people, at best, or open positions internally only, since they‚Äôre can‚Äôt afford external candidates in this market.", Monetisation, Singapore,7-Jun-22,FALSE

Especially people in the middle management who claims to be subject matter experts but leave the dirty jobs to the junior hires, steals credit and get all the limelight.

There seems to be a spike in positive reviews in an orchestrated manner. Hence, do take positive reviews with a huge pinch of salt. 

If you‚Äôre just looking for a job that pays sufficiently, and career progression and learnings are not of importance to you, you may skip reading. 

Graduates are used as cheap resources for projects so that projects can be sold cheaply. The bulk of graduate‚Äôs salary is funded by the government because of the graduate programme scheme.

Over promise in proposals or in their words to clients and under deliver (ie. no good qualified expertise placed on projects).

Clients are always right and the welfare of staff does not matter. Project delays or issues are blamed on staff executing the project, when most of the time it is due to poor project management. Staff are expected work overtime to catch up. 

Projects are constantly delayed because of poor project management - ie. no good quality project managers.

Zero career progression, your progression is based of how long you stay with the company and how much you engage with the management. Also, if you are good at talking, you will make it too.

2. Adding to point number 1, managers have the same mindset that junior employees should operate the same way these managers operated back when they entered the workforce decades ago. ""Back when I started working, ..."" is a common phrase thrown around. 
3. Managers take things very personal here. Disobey them, challenge their thinking or do anything out of the ordinary and you may find yourself not on a project and floating on the bench forever. Don't worry though because then, you can watch movies or learn something new or psst. find a new job. 
4. The model of outsourcing work to India is flawed. Zero pride taken in their work, leading to poor or even no deliverables produced and local resources have to take the heat.
5. Perception is key here. You do not have to have substance. (I guess that's why we have a ton of managers here who are empty cans). Simply speak anything and everything that crosses your mind and you may find yourself getting into the goody books of senior management. 
6. They constantly lie that they are a startup, being agile and flat. Truth of the matter is, the company is constantly sticks to the cash cows of legacy software  (which is technically not wrong) but leaves zero room for tinkering with new technologies. 
7. We do not have a strong learning and development plan for employees here. Really not sure what the HR team is doing. Probably 100% tied on hiring new employees because there is simply high attrition rate. CEO gives the excuse that the attrition rate is fine because it's the same across all other consulting firms. 
8. Too many hired from the same country, bringing along their own working culture that may work for them over there but not in Singapore. Again refer to point number 1. Company pretends to be a supporter of gender diversity (Women@Capgemini) but nothing to address the elephant in the room. 
9. No clear strategy of what products to have deep expertise in, leading to half-hearted attempts at training, leading to not having the proper resources at bids, leading to lousy delivery if we magically win projects, leading to customers that do not return for repeat business. Well, that's for another management team to worry because by then it wouldn't be a problem for the current management team right?
10. Simple things such as having templated assets to streamline the process of working on a bid or on a project are missing. Hold on, come to think of it, they do have templated assets. Templated assets for hiring events. See point number 7. 
11. Graduate programme is a sham. It's subsidised by EDB and it's another excuse for the company to bring in cheap local talent to simply make up the numbers. When e-learning counts as training and managers can simply concoct some presentation showing the growth of graduates, it's no wonder that they are still meeting the KPIs set by EDB.

Gojek,1,VP,"Flexible work hours, huge scale","I was at GoJek for around a year - Built out and launched key products, interacted directly with CEO/ CXO/ SVP/ leadership. Few observations :

-  Lack of data-driven decision making - There's no culture of evidence (qualitative/ quantitative) based product strategy. Just ideas made up in the air based on ""visionary thinking of the CEO"" or some hearsay/ article read by some SVP.  They'd change their decisions over the fly over a couple of Whatsapp conversations without full context of the decision.

- Project Management (and not Product management) - When I joined, I was pleasantly surprised that GoJek got so big with the current product culture - but after a few months, I realised that the success of GoJek was its ability replicate US/ India/ China models in a greenfield market like Indonesia really quickly. Not focusing on innovation, but focusing on rapid replication + delivery. Not focusing on iterative experimentation, but just speed of shipping features. Works/ worked for Indonesia, but detrimental to the growth of a Product manager's leadership/ analytical thinking.

- *Very* hierarchal - The decisions are pushed downwards from the SVP/ GM/ CXO, and the Senior Product managers act like Project managers executing a mandate given from the top. It was sad to see limited bottom-up input in Product strategy (akin to Chinese product work culture).

- Lack of management & top-tech exposure at the leadership level - Although there's a lot of fan-fare around how the CEO is a game-changer for Indonesia (and maybe its true from an Indonesian context), I believe there's a lack of management/ leadership at the CXO/ SVP level. Few in the senior leadership have exposure working at Top-tech companies (FAANG/ Tier 2 Tech) previously, leading to a lack of understanding around how to build product teams, and building the right product culture.

- Indo favouritism at the leadership level - There's a sense of favouritism if you're an Indonesian at the leadership level. That's an accepted fact across the company (and sometimes even acknowledged by the leadership in the name of patriotism) - but is very unhealthy and non-inclusive in the long run.

Resources. Yes, teams are understaffed as people leave one after another. Go figure.  

Management - they only want to meet the deadlines and deliver the projects...at the expense of their staffs. Worked everyday (12++ hours) including weekends for almost a month, and several weekends later, but wasn't offered even a single off-in-lieu. Pity. 

Pay & appraisals. Contrary to most reviewers here, I don't really consider this to GIC's advantage...unless you haven't worked with other financial institutions or I just didn't get a good offer.

Understaffed, people expected to do end to end work - ops, engineering, admin tasks, research, developments, all by one person. A company which values the contributions by tech would have dedicated headcount for each function.

GIC,1,Toxic work culture,"- The pay isn't bad (as long as you're willing to put up with all the Cons that come along with the job)
- Potential to be involved in much larger deals of >$500 million that one many not easily see in smaller companies
- Smart, diligent colleagues whom you actually enjoy spending time with even outside of work hours","- As mentioned by other reviewers, GIC is incredibly bureaucratic. The investment approval process is slow and unnecessarily tedious, resulting in many missed opportunities because by the time we've submitted our first bid for a deal, the seller has already gone to Round 3 of bidding with other potential companies/buyers.
- Highly political environment where sucking up to the higher ups is not only recommended, but outright necessary if you want to get promoted.
- Lots of duplicative internal reports to be done so you spend a lot less time working on actual deals
- The unofficial company motto that employees swear by: ""lie low, live long"". In other words, management tries to make it appear as if they are progressive and open to voices of dissent but in reality, ""the nail that sticks out gets hammered down"" is the more applicable maxim at GIC. So if you're going to work here, just lie low and act as a ""yes man"" to senior management and you'll have a much smoother tenure.
- Face time is INCREDIBLY important. As an investment manager here, I have often felt the pressure to stay back until 9pm on a regular basis even when I'm done with work as that's what many colleagues do as well (even though they too are done with the day's work). Suspicions about the importance of face time were confirmed after I overheard the Country Head explain to another senior manager: ""I like my seat because I can see the door from here so I know what time people come in and leave the office."" Actual work done appears to be less important than how much time you're willing to spend showing face in the office.
- Poor work-life balance (you're either on the sending or receiving end of 2am emails and everyone sees this as normal, even when there aren't live deals or any looming deadline for a particular project)
- If going on business trips, you are expected to leave on a Sunday and return on a Saturday so that the entire Mon-Fri can be used for meetings. If you fly long haul like I do, you will effectively lose 2 days of the weekend once a month without compensation for the lost time with family. Management doesn't think there's anything wrong with that.
- Due to the above, place is terrible if you want to have any amount of work-life balance.
- Somewhat hard to leave as you need to give 3 months' notice; just need to plan well in advance and negotiate harder with your next employer about when you can join them.
- Pay is good but once you work out the pay given the hours you work as an investment manager (about 90-100 hours a week) you're better off elsewhere.

CAVEAT: The above is based on my several years of work experience at the GIC headquarters in Singapore. I get the sense that colleagues in the other offices in the US and the UK enjoy a more relaxed and reasonable working environment.

Grab,2,Politically charged work environment with minimal focus on engineering excellence,"Grab offers reasonable compensation in SE Asia and has some employee-friendly policies. A few of the engineers are technically competent, helpful, and demonstrate a collaborative attitude.","The primary driver of Grab's growth was the abundance of VC funds, which facilitated promotions and marketing campaigns targeted at driver-partners and customers. Grab acquired Uber's SE Asia operations because of Softbank's support, and they were the principal investor in both the companies. Uber's technology platform is superior, and its operations management methodology is better than Grab by many orders of magnitude. Browse to the public Github repos of Uber and Grab to get a better idea. 
The work-environment in Grab remains very politically charged. There are hordes of engineers who are incompetent but get promoted to G5 or G6 solely based on ""good relations"" with their reporting managers.
During my stint at Grab, I have across multiple instances in which a team of engineers would attempt to reinvent the wheel. A group built a documentation microsite using Hugo instead of using an existing system like Confluence (Wiki). There was yet another group that developed a mock-server, instead of using WireMock or MounteBank. Furthermore, the Engineering Lead was blissfully unaware of these open-source tools. Finally, this custom mock-server was buggy, painful to use, and did not have a single useful feature. 
The application codebase is bloated and is full of unsound (if not outrightly bad) engineering practices. The situation is so dire that Android Studio is unable to load the application codebase. The official recommendation on one of the documentation microsites is to use an alternate code editor (vi or vscode). Furthermore, you won't be able to build the codebase on your local machine, and the only way you can test your code is to use CI or to use remote infrastructure using Mainframer. 
The processes that are in place make engineering teams feel worthless and actively infantilize engineers and individual contributors.

AWS is most likely guaranteed. You can work here your whole life and not get into any issues if you show up to work on time just do your job. Good if you like corporate environment and your boss takes a liking to your work I guess. But then again it's the same everywhere we go (except tech companies). Work is sometimes challenging and fast moving, which could be a pro or con depending on your style (and the 'challenges' presented). Career opportunities is definitely there if you are a good performer and be someone loud/visible (again this depends on your bosses).","There is really too much to list from my perspective, I don't know where to even start. I will update this if/when I can with my grandfather/grandmother stories. But for now, those in IT related fields thinking of coming over, I would suggest to stay away if you can as there are a lot of red flags (and I personally came across a few already). Don't waste your time here, unless you really need the job or want to experience M1 or put M1 on your resume. Be prepared for OT especially if you want your bonuses (yes, a lot of us do OT). If you want to change management way of doing things, be prepared for frustration as things move glacier slow here, unless you are THE management then more power to you. I even wouldn't want my worst enemy to join M1. It is really bad right now (at least from my point of view), please find other better (at least for devs) jobs. Now thinking back, I don't have a single thing good that happened in the past year to talk about, except WFH which is more flexible, and M1 is practicing this as per govt guidelines which is great! But I think deep down all of us know it's because one has no more excuse to leave work on time to take the shuttle bus home :D It's a win-win situation as employees get to stay home and M1 get to save money on maintenance and transport claims and get greatly increased productivity from their employees. People looking for yearly pay raise need no apply, it's not guaranteed, and this year it's due to COVID and the bad landscape (p.s. some people still have pay raises, just that keeping it on the DL so not all go and ask for pay raise)

- Very hierarchical senior management with limited transparency", Vice President/Chief Executive, Singapore,18-Aug-18,TRUE
Gojek,1,VP,"Flexible work hours, huge scale","I was at GoJek for around a year - Built out and launched key products, interacted directly with CEO/ CXO/ SVP/ leadership. Few observations :

-  Lack of data-driven decision making - There's no culture of evidence (qualitative/ quantitative) based product strategy. Just ideas made up in the air based on ""visionary thinking of the CEO"" or some hearsay/ article read by some SVP.  They'd change their decisions over the fly over a couple of Whatsapp conversations without full context of the decision.

- Project Management (and not Product management) - When I joined, I was pleasantly surprised that GoJek got so big with the current product culture - but after a few months, I realised that the success of GoJek was its ability replicate US/ India/ China models in a greenfield market like Indonesia really quickly. Not focusing on innovation, but focusing on rapid replication + delivery. Not focusing on iterative experimentation, but just speed of shipping features. Works/ worked for Indonesia, but detrimental to the growth of a Product manager's leadership/ analytical thinking.

- *Very* hierarchal - The decisions are pushed downwards from the SVP/ GM/ CXO, and the Senior Product managers act like Project managers executing a mandate given from the top. It was sad to see limited bottom-up input in Product strategy (akin to Chinese product work culture).

- Lack of management & top-tech exposure at the leadership level - Although there's a lot of fan-fare around how the CEO is a game-changer for Indonesia (and maybe its true from an Indonesian context), I believe there's a lack of management/ leadership at the CXO/ SVP level. Few in the senior leadership have exposure working at Top-tech companies (FAANG/ Tier 2 Tech) previously, leading to a lack of understanding around how to build product teams, and building the right product culture.

- Indo favouritism at the leadership level - There's a sense of favouritism if you're an Indonesian at the leadership level. That's an accepted fact across the company (and sometimes even acknowledged by the leadership in the name of patriotism) - but is very unhealthy and non-inclusive in the long run.

The Supreme HR Advisory,3,Pros and Cons,"This will be one of the truthful review as I do not manipulate information

To be honest, working in Supreme HR Advisory wasn't ""that bad"" as claimed by others. 

Pros of working with the company

1) The company provides relatively high basic for new joiners / seniors 

2) The commission scheme of the company is on the higher scheme in the market compared to other recruitment firms

3) On time salary payout / commission payout 

4) It's sales role, definitely the harder you work, the more you get in return

5) You get to enjoy shorter working hours when you achieve your monthly on target ; ie 10am - 5pm (with 1 hour lunch and another 30 mins break)

6) Location of company is central, easy access to MRT and food courts

7) You will be able to gain exposure to all different kinds of roles here regardless of job grades

8) Birds of a feather flock together. You will get to meet a few colleagues who will motivate you together if you're lucky.

9) Bosses are friendly, and helpful undeniably. They are always there when you have any uncertainties. They do work till the wee hours to resolve issues / reply you (but not your team leads)","Cons, this might be a little hurtful as it might hit the feeling of some of the management / employees 

1) Training upon joining was too ""anyhow"", wasn't detailed enough. Knowing that time and speed is everything but without sufficient and in depth training, it will only lead to mentees / new employees to latch on seniors / mentors all the time (e.g: asking questions that they should have already known / making mistakes that they shouldn't have, repeatedly)

2) Understand that the management is often changing the company's SOP for the better but it may be confusing and hard to pick up as it happens too often

3) Gossip environment within the company, bad-mouthing, twisting of facts and manipulation of information for their own good. (This is inclusive of everyone in the office regardless of their rank). If you want to be out of all these, you just keep quiet and not talk to anyone about anything, and just work from the moment you start work till the end of the day

4) Team Leads did not set a good example for their mentees / team. This is based on my own observation - how could a team lead be successful in leading a team if they talk bad about their own mentee behind their backs? A successful team lead isn't just about achieving high sales for the team, but also a strong bonded team that will ensure the team work together as one

5) Some team leads enforces and would only want their team to work on their own team's role (regardless if it's responsive / moving roles) due to the additional incentive they could get from closing own team's roles. I personally 100% do understand from their point of view, but they neglected the fact that your mentees / team members are also working as sales, they of course do work on other roles where it can bring sales and money right? Pushing them to work on own team's role all the time is typically selfish because you only care about yourself

6) Do expect to work 8am -7pm if you do not achieve your targets, and also weekends. So no hanging out with bf/gf, no me time, no family time, no reading time if you are not on target, you'll be asked to ""have tea"" and constant nagging that will drain you even further, which is not helping

7) Team leads only care about sales, and occasionally will ask if you faced any problem. You have sales, everything is possible when you ask for something. When you have no sales, you better shut cause it will lead to a chain of naggings and 'moral lessons'. But tbh, even you tell them the problem you faced, they will just throw the ball back to you and ask you think about it.", Senior Recruitment Consultant, Singapore,22-Nov-21,FALSE

Trakomatic,1,Worst Startup with Unprofessional Management,You will meet a lot of new colleagues during your short stay at the organization.,"For all Investors, potential employees and customers, please see the true situation at Trakomatic. 

Trakomatic is a small start-up with an extremely toxic culture. The organization is run by three highly unprofessional & egocentric founders who treat employees quite poorly (absolute servitude).

As soon as an employee joins the organization, you are involuntarily added to several WhatsApp groups; ‚Äòone to one‚Äô communication is conducted on these groups till late night. You are constantly monitored for your whereabouts (even at lunchtime), employees are made to work late hours (most days end at 9.00 pm), staff work to exhaustion, are famished and are not allowed to leave the office till the unreasonable deadlines are met. Post the office hours, you are interrogated on Whatapps, it is quite normal for the management to ask for work around midnight requiring morning submission (including working over the weekends).

The COO is a true con artist, 90% of company departures are attributed to his workplace harassment (he constantly raises his voice, insulting & degrading employees, publicly), no one hired as part of his team has stayed with the company. He has no knowledge of the products, is a sub-standard manager, poor salesman & quite a repulsive human being. He will constantly lie to clients & will not stop talking during external and internal meetings. His organization skills are legendary, he organizes all the wrong information in proper excel sheets, which everyone MUST fill. He should be reported for his employee harassment (his occasional mental instability & resulting behavior) to the relevant authorities.  

The CEO lacks intellect; this is the second company he is virtually running down. He will constantly ask the same questions again and again (which he fails to comprehend & claims he has answers to every question), he will constantly push for documentation, first on excel, then on word and finally on PowerPoint. He is ‚Äòat best‚Äô a poor manager with no leadership skills & vision. He is party to COO's & CTO's employee treatment & should be held responsible for the Managements behavior; standing quietly like a coward while hardworking employees are mistreated shows his leadership acumen.

The CTO is another inept IT manager, he can't develop any products (even the core technology is external & does not work), He will often manipulate data to please clients (& use client data without authorization, including recording videos & distributing externally), suffers from severe rage issues, he does not understand AI or any Data Technology. He is another slave driver & will demand work from employees over the weekends. Apart from his internal issues, he will cheat the external vendors by stalling projects & not paying for contracted outsourced work. 
It's well known, all the positive Glassdoor feedback is written by forcing existing employees & by the COO himself. 

Overall, the company is badly run with a depressing environment & shrunk to a handful of employees. Investors, potential recruits, vendors & customers should stay away; the three founders will rob you of your capital, careers, your payments & data.

Most consultant get terminated due to lack of training or nonsensical reasons and end up paying huge sum to the company. Boss only hire Malaysian as they stereotype Singaporean. (They are Singaporean themselves)
1. I've never seen anyone claimed commission as the rollover never reset and every consultant BEAR the ads and resume purchasing cost on their own. (When top sales of the company left, ended up paying almost 1 month of their basic salary, others will leave paying around at least $1,000 and above, highest amount as far as I know is $4,000)
P/S: They even make you pay for your own EA registration, but this is known as CHEAPO in the eye of the boss if client are doing it, they have no shame doing it themselves though.
2. As a 360 recruitment firm, consultants NEVER meet up with candidates to prep them for interview, everything is solely done via phone calls/email/text messages ONLY. For your information, I am meeting 80% of my candidates in my current firm.
3. You work for a boss, not with a leader. It is mentioned in their job ads that full mentorship training is provided but all the boss did was some experience sharing with irrelevant information that WILL NOT help in your job for 2~4 days (subjected to their mood)
4. Instead of providing solutions when receiving niche positions as a generalist, the only ""help"" boss will provide to you is google yourself/ DROP your orders (most of the time), even after hard work of searching for leads and cold calling, then they label you with stubborn/ not learning what they teach.
5. They are the MOST calculative boss you'll meet but they claimed themselves as generous people. Your sales target is being accumulated from the FIRST DAY when you join where 2~3 days of ""FULL TRAINING"" will take place and before you have the chance to start looking for leads and cold calling (Remember there's no RESET of accumulated sales target as boss feel is unfair for them). You will then start the cycle of searching of leads and cold calling, will take at least 1 month for a case closure if you're capable or lucky but if your candidate have to serve notice (commonly 1 month and above), by then you will have snowball 1 month + 1 week (""FULL TRAINING + Weekend) sales target. In order to pass your probation, you have to clear all your sales target which have started before you can do anything about it. Not many consultant will pass the probation unless they are very lucky to close big case with immediate availability candidate.
6. The boss are superb in marketing as they keep all ugly and unachievable things hidden when posting ads for hiring. All the benefits are only subjected to confirmed staff as mentioned above, only very FEW can be confirmed (if so it's after 9 months of probation after keep getting extended probation period)
7. Working individually as a generalist, you will be like a baby being thrown into the sea but demanded to swim well on your own.
8. Flat structure with no area to grow/promote. After working for 1 year, your title will be promoted to Senior Executive Consultant, 2 years then become Assistant Consulting Manager, but your job scope will still be same as day 1, just with a more fancy title.

At Squarepoint, do not dream of sharing matters close to your heart like for example the state of your mental health. I came clean about my anxiety issues to my boss but she shuts me down & had no sympathy for me while I cried in the meeting room in front of her. I had to thank her though because she terminated me anyways for being the strongest person in the room to have the courage to talk to her about my health.
